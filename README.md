**Department Of Justice Website Clone with Integrated Chatbot**
This project is a clone of the Department of Justice website, integrated with a custom-built chatbot. The website is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the chatbot is powered by Chatbase, an AI-driven tool.

**Features:**
Chatbot Integration: The chatbot is designed to answer legal queries by providing relevant law sections in a simple and precise manner.
Target Audience: This tool is aimed at individuals seeking legal help, particularly those who are illiterate or unaware of laws protecting them from exploitation.

**Technologies:**
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Chatbot: Chatbase (AI-powered)

**Future Enhancements:**
We plan to further develop the chatbot by writing the code manually to provide more advanced features, such as:
Speech Recognition: Allowing users to interact with the chatbot via voice commands.
Multilingual Support: Enabling the chatbot to communicate in multiple languages to reach a broader audience.
Read Aloud Feature: Implementing text-to-speech capabilities to assist visually impaired users or those with low literacy.
